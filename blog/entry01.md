**Entry 01 - Hello!**

Hello, my name is Alexandra, and I wrote my first "Hello, World!" program a little over two years ago. When I'm not programming/studying I like to draw, play games or pick stuff up and put them back down again. I have not touched JavaScript for quite a while, so I'll have some brushing up to do on that for sure!
Hope you enjoy my very beautiful blog.
