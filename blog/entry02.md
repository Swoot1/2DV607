**Entry 02 - Lots of theory and repetition**

I've been looking through some basic JS for repetition. I've also checked out the videos on React and Redux that can be found on the course page. I did the tutorial on the React page as well. Interesting for sure, will have to go back and review it probably though. I read the Redux comic, which I found helpful! Might take me some time to completely figure out React/Redux though, but I'll get started with some coding as soon as possible and we'll see how it goes. 

Time to think of a project!
