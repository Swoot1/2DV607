**Entry 05 - Redux**

So, I'm finally going to try working with Redux. I will attempt to recreate the small application that I had but using Redux. I used most of Andreas Fridlund's React Redux example (http://afrxx09.blogspot.se/2015/11/simple-react-redux-example.html) and changed some small things, but that's about it for now. I'll probably do some small tutorials and read this guide further (which I already started): https://github.com/happypoulp/redux-tutorial .
Right now, all my cells change color at the same time, which is obviously not what I want, so the next step is to figure that part out!
