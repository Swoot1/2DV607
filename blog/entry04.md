**Entry 04 - Click!**

Been working on some on-click stuff for my pretty little squares. Started out with just a simple alert when an element was clicked (sorry David, please don't fail me). However, they now turn black if you click them, and then they go back to green if you click them again! (**GASP**)

I suppose I need to start looking into using Redux soon enough, but I am still not completely sure how it works. I did start taking notes on it though (mostly from the nice comic) so I'll keep doing that until I got the basics down.
