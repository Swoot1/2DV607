**Entry 03 - A table**

Been reading about and messing around with React today. Took me way longer than it should have to make a table, but hey, it's there!
I feel like I just did it in a very simple way, but depending on how I'm moving forward with my revolutionary table I might not need a lot more.
Thinking of making some sort of simple game perhaps.
